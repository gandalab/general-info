# Protocols for Collaborating with the GandaLab Github account

This protocol describes how members of the lab should interact with the GandaLab Github account for storing finished code and data on Github. Also consult this blog post: https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/

## Terminology:  

**GANDALAB** = GandaLab repo at this URL: https://github.com/gandalab  

**REPO** = GandaLab repository of interest (for example: general-info)  

**YOU** = Your Github URL

### Make a Github account and connect Git to RStudio

This is described in the "Git Started with Git" section under the GandaLab README.md

### Fork the GandaLab repo of interest
At the GANDALAB page, navigate to the REPO and click “Fork”. This creates a clone of the REPO and creates a local REPO in YOU (your Github). 

Navigate to the REPO stored in YOU (your Github). The URL should look something like: `github.com/YOU/REPO`.

Click the green “Code” button and copy the URL of the REPO to your clipboard. Open RStudio and create a new project. Checkout the project from Version Control and select “Git”, then paste the REPO URL. 

It is “best Git practice” to always work within a branch that is NOT the master branch. This will help you if you need to roll back any mistakes. 

To create a new branch to work in, open the Terminal window in RStudio and type `git branch BRANCHNAME`, then `git checkout BRANCHNAME`. The first step creates a new branch, and the second step moves you into the new branch.

### Set GandaLab as the upstream repo to get master changes  

Github does not automatically recognize GANDALAB as the upstream repo when you fork it. This is unintuitive, but you must take the extra step in order to pull upstream changes.

First, type `git remote -v`. You should see something like this: 
`origin  https://github.com/EmilyB17/amr-heavymetal.git (fetch)`  
`origin  https://github.com/EmilyB17/amr-heavymetal.git (push)`

Then, type `git remote add upstream` followed by the URL of the master repo. This should be something like: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/gandalab/REPO`.

Type `git remote -v` again. You should see something like this: 
`origin  https://github.com/EmilyB17/amr-heavymetal.git (fetch)`
`origin  https://github.com/EmilyB17/amr-heavymetal.git (push)`
`upstream        https://github.com/gandalab/amr-heavymetal (fetch)`
`upstream        https://github.com/gandalab/amr-heavymetal (push)`

Now, you should be able to type `git pull upstream master`. This specifies that you’re pulling changes made from the “upstream” remote and updating those changes in your local clone.

*Be sure to pull upstream before making any pull requests. This will help us avoid merge conflicts.*

### Make your local changes and merge to GANDALAB/REPO

You should be working in your local branch (not the master branch). When you complete your work, save the files. There are two ways to make commits through RStudio; you can use the Terminal window, or you can use the point-and-click option towards the top of the RStudio window.

There are 4 steps to making changes in a forked REPO:

**1. Staging changes**  
In the terminal, type `git add FILENAME`

**2. Commit changes**  
This stores the changes in Git. In the terminal, type `git commit FILENAME -m "MESSAGE"`. Note that the `-m` allows you to add a text line about the changes you are making. This is important - your commit message should be detailed to let your collaborators know what you changed.

**3. Push your local changes** 
You have commited changes locally, so the next step is to push them to Github to *your local copy of the forked REPO*. In the terminal, type `git push origin BRANCHNAME`. 

**4. Make a pull request to merge your changes to GANDALAB**
In a web browser, navigate to YOU/REPO. You should see a line at the top that says you have made recent edits, and a green button that says `Create Pull Request`. Click on that and follow the steps to create a pull request. This sends a request to the REPO owner (GANDALAB) and asks them to merge your changes into the GANDALAB/REPO.
